            <p>
                Fasten your seatbelts and embark on our interactive data story. Through this story, you will get to understand the world of
                cinema from a different perspective. Side-by-side, we will explore the factors that make a movie successful and try answer the question
                one billion-dollar question: Can we predict the success of a movie?
            </p>
            <p>
                We will take you through the journey of the movie industry, from the early days of black-and-white silent films to the modern-day
                blockbusters. We will explore the trends that have shaped the industry, the genres that have dominated the box office, and the actors
                that have brought magic to the screen.

                But first of all, let's introduce ourselves. We are a team of students with different backgrounds from EPFL's CS-401 course 
                united by this project. We dived into the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/">CMU Movie dataset</a> wondering if we
                could predict the success of a movie. But let's start from the beginning.

        <section id="defining-success">
            <h2>What is Success ?</h2>
            <p>
                For this story, we're looking at box office revenue as our measure of success. But money isn't everything. 
                A movie can be loved by everyone who watched it or win tons of awards even if it didn't make a ton of money. 
                By sticking with box office revenue, we're focusing on financial success, but it's important to keep in mind there's 
                more than one way to measure a movie's impact.

        <section id="release_date">
            <h2>Timing Is Everything</h2>
            <p>
                As we can imagine, the release date as a strong impact on the film's performance. First by plotting the data,
                we discover that summer is the best period to release a movie. More specifically, in the month of June. This 
                was confirmed when assessing the correlation between the release month and the revenue. (TODO : add the correlation value)
            </p>
            <p>
                This is obviously linked with the fact that people are more likely to go to the cinema during the summer : 
                kids are on holiday and parents are looking for activities to do with them.

        <section id="runtime">
            <h2>Too short, too long, or just right?</h2>
            <p>
                The runtime of a movie is a key factor in its success. Too short and the audience might feel cheated, too 
                long and they might get bored. But before that, the evloution of the runtime of movies reflects the technical 
                evolution of the industry. In the early days, movies were very short. But when technique was no longer a problem, 
                movies started to get longer and longer before shrinking again to stabillize around 105 minutes.

                Of course, you could say that this data does not represent he ground truth but only shows what happened in the past. 
                And you are absolutly right ! We are not saying that short movies will performed less but simply that less and less 
                movies are produced with a short runtime. One reason could be the use of different platform like youtube for this 
                kind of formats.

                In general, films with younger casts seem to perform better on average, suggesting a potential trend that producers 
                might want to explore further. Younger actors may connect better with certain target audiences, particularly with 
                the youngest. However, while this observation is intriguing, it's important to approach it with caution. The smaller sample 
                size for younger casts makes the data less stable and more prone to volatility, meaning this trend could be more 
                coincidental than reliable. In contrast, the larger quantity of samples for films featuring adult casts provides more 
                robust statitics. It's a good place to remind you to be careful when reading data !
