            <h2>Introduction: Lights, Camera, Data!</h2>
            <p>
                Fasten your seatbelts and embark on our interactive data story. Through this article, you will get to understand the world of
                cinema from a different perspective. Side-by-side, we will explore the factors that make a movie successful and try answer the
                one billion-dollar question: Can we predict the success of a movie?
            </p>
            <p>
                We will take you through the journey of the movie industry, from the early days of black-and-white silent films to the modern-day
                blockbusters. We will explore the trends that have shaped the industry, the genres that have dominated the box office, and the actors
                that have brought magic to the screen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But first of all, let's introduce ourselves. We are a team of students with different backgrounds from EPFL's CS-401 course 
                united by this project. We dived into the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/">CMU Movie dataset</a> wondering if we
                could predict the success of a movie. But let's start from the beginning.
            </p>

        <section id="defining-success">
            <h2>What is Success ?</h2>
            <p>
                For this story, we're looking at box office revenue as our measure of success. But money isn't everything. 
                A movie can be loved by everyone who watched it or win tons of awards even if it didn't make a ton of money. 
                By sticking with box office revenue, we're focusing on financial success, but it's important to keep in mind there's 
                more than one way to measure a movie's impact.
            </p>

        <section id="release_date">
            <h2>Timing is (not) Everything</h2>
            <p>
                As we can imagine, the release date has a strong impact on the film's performance. First by plotting the data,
                we discover that summer is the best period to release a movie. More specifically, in the month of June. This 
                was confirmed when assessing the correlation between the release month and the revenue. A correlation of 0.072 suggests release season alone is not a strong predictor of revenue in our dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can be linked with the fact that people are more likely to go to the cinema during the summer : 
                kids are on holiday and parents are looking for activities to do with them.
            </p>

        <section id="genre">
            <h2>The Genre Game: Trends that shape tastes</h2>
            <p>
                A wise man said once : "You can't please every audience, but the right genre pleases the right crowd". Keeping that in 
                mind, it was for us a very important step to understand what are the main genres, both in terms of number of movies and 
                average revenue.
            </p>
            <div id="chart-container">
                <iframe src="assets/ploty-img/top_genres.html"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div id="chart-container">
                <iframe src="assets/ploty-img/genres_revenue.html"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
                Different times have different preferences, therefore, we also investigated the evolution of the main genres throughout the years. 
                Doing so, we could drastically improve the prediction of the success of a movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                We found some pretty interesing results, both about the genres and the movie industry in general. Period pieces dominated the 30's,
                almost every genre had a peak in the 70's followed by a vallley in the 80's. We can also see that there are some genres
                that are indeed leaving the crowd behind, leadered by fantasy. But not all is good, specially for indie who is not doing so well.
            </p>

        <section id="runtime">
            <h2>Too short, too long, or just right?</h2>
            <p>
                The runtime of a movie is a key factor in its success. Too short and the audience might feel cheated, too 
                long and they might get bored. We have discovered that between 1920 and 1950, movies were usually slightly shorter,   
                probably due to technical reasons. But with time, movies started to get longer and longer before shrinking 
                again to stabillize around 105 minutes. 
            </p>
            <div id="chart-container">
                <iframe src="assets/ploty-img/runtime_category.html"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
                But what about the revenue? We analysed the average revenue for each runtime categories and found with confidence 
                that movies considered as "long" compare to others tend to perform better than shorter movies.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Of course, you could say that this data does not represent the ground truth but only shows what happened in the past. 
                And you are absolutly right ! We are not saying that short movies will perform less, simply that in average, short movies
                tend to perform less than long movies.

        <section id="location">
            <h2>Exploring the Impact of a Movie's Location</h2>
            <p>
                The place where a movie's story happens is not just a background : it adds to the story and helps the audience connect. 
                But how important is it really? In this part, we look at how the location of a movie might influence its success. 
                We ask if some countries work better for audiences around the world and if this impacts how profitable the 
                movie becomes.

            <h2>Who Brings the Magic?</h2>

            <div id="chart-container">
                <iframe src="assets/ploty-img/actor_age_group_revenues.html"></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
                Looking into the data, it seems that films with younger casts seem to perform better on average, suggesting a potential trend that producers 
                might want to explore further. Younger actors may connect better with certain target audiences, particularly with 
                the youngest. However, while this observation is interesting, it's important to approach it with caution, as usual. The smaller sample 
                size for younger casts makes the data less stable, as can be seen by the standard error, although, even then, the trend is clear. 
                In contrast, the larger quantity of samples for films featuring adult casts provides more robust statitics. 
                In the end, we are only analyzing the average, so it does not mean that a movie with a younger cast will always perform better.
                It's a good place to remind you to be careful when analyzing data! 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Redefining the Spotlight</h3>
            <p>
                Ethnic diversity is transforming the film industry. Movies with diverse casts are increasingly outperforming those with 
                homogeneous ensembles. However, historical data shows a preference for predominantly white casts in the past. 
                Today, this trend is shifting, reflecting the growing importance of inclusive storytelling.   
            </p>
            <div id="chart-container">
                <iframe src="assets/ploty-img/revenue_ethnic_diversity_periods.html"></iframe>
            </div>
            <h3>Stories in Every Shade</h3>
            <p>
                Looking closely at the data, it was very surprising to see that ethnic diversity plays a key role in a movie's success.
                In fact, we found that movies with a more diverse cast tend to perform better at the box office. 
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                But is that really it ?
                By looking more closely, it seems that the past century favored movies with a white cast (english, british and 
                australian ethnicities). But the trend is changing and we can see how it improved through the years.

            <h3>Faces That Fill Seats</h3>
            <p>
                Up to now, we putted aside one huge factor that makes people go to the theater and see a movie: their favorite actors.
                As an actor, it is very important to have a personal approach when acting and to be able to connect with the audience. 
                Building a persona that people like is key for people to come see you again. In the analysis below, we tried to see 
                which faces of the past century have created the craze and led to a financial success.

                Until now, we have been looking at explicit and quantitative data. Although looking at the numbers is important, it 
                was clear for us that there is more to a movie than just numbers. We wanted to dive deeper into the emotions behind the 
                movie and for that, we performed a sentimental analysis on their summary.

                <p>
                    The Logistic Regression model was evaluated based on multiple performance metrics. Here are the key results and their implications:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Confusion Matrix:</b> The confusion matrix highlights the model's performance across four categories: True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives. While the model correctly identifies many non-successes (True Negatives: 1230), it struggles with predicting successes (True Positives: 69). This indicates an imbalance in the data and a limitation in the model's feature set.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Precision-Recall Curve:</b> This curve visualizes the trade-off between precision and recall. As recall increases (capturing more successes), precision decreases (more false positives). This trade-off highlights the challenge of optimizing the model for both.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ROC Curve:</b> The ROC curve provides a measure of the model's discriminatory power, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.81. This indicates that the model performs well. However, better feature engineering and additional data could enhance this performance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These results show the need for further refinement, including rebalancing the dataset, exploring additional features, especially the budget and marketing spend.

            <h2>Epilogue</h2>
            <p>
                Great story isn't it ? Indeed, we had a lot of fun exploring the data and trying to understand the movie industry. But from 
                this analysis, many aspects must still be discussed.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the casting : it has the same biases through the years as our society. Hence, we cannot say that films 
                with a predominance of male actors will continue to perform better since it was (still is) harder for women to lead roles 
                in big movies. Movies with high ethnic diversity perform better but the ethnicities that lead to this result are mainly 
                european ethnicities.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also have to keep in mind that the data we used is not exhaustive. We only used the CMU dataset and we know that 
                there are many other datasets that could have been used. We also know that the data is not perfect and that we had to 
                clean it a lot before being able to use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we have to remember that the movie industry is an art industry and analysis of the past does not predict the future. 
                The last words are a remember that the data is not the truth and that we have to be careful when analyzing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And you, what films are you going to watch next ?
