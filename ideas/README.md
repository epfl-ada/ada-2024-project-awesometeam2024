# Project Ideas

## Idea 1: Analyzing Character Deaths
**Goal**: Predict whether a character will die in a movie based on their role, relationships, and actions throughout the plot.

**Research Questions**:
- What character traits, actions, and relationships make certain characters more likely to die?
- Are there specific narrative patterns used in movies that lead to character deaths?
- How do character death patterns differ across genres, such as action movies versus dramas?

**High-Level Steps**:
- Extract character interactions, roles, and actions from the CMU dataset. These features will include dangerous activities, interactions with antagonists, and pivotal moments in the plot.
- Identify common narrative patterns that lead to character deaths and analyze the consistency of these patterns across different genres.
- Develop a model to predict character deaths, exploring genre-specific trends, such as whether certain genres tend to use more predictable character deaths.

## Idea 2: Global Events' Influence on Movies
**Goal**: Investigate how major global events like wars, financial crises, and social movements influence the production and thematic focus of films across genres.

**Research Questions**:
- How do global events influence the number of movies produced in different genres?
- Are there noticeable shifts in movie themes before, during, and after significant world events?
- Do certain genres thrive or decline in response to events like wars or political unrest?

**High-Level Steps**:
- Use the GDELT database to track significant global historical events and combine this with the CMU dataset to analyze how movie production, genres, and themes shift in response.
- Categorize movies by genre and release year, and compare the volume and type of movies produced before, during, and after these major events.
- Investigate trends in thematic focus, such as whether social dramas increase during periods of political unrest or whether war films surge after military conflicts.

## Idea 3: Evolution of Superheroes in Movies
**Goal**: Explore how the portrayal of superheroes has evolved over time, reflecting changing societal values and issues.

**Research Questions**:
- How have superhero stories and character traits evolved in response to societal issues and real-world events?
- Are there key moments in superhero movie history where societal changes are directly reflected in character portrayals?
- How do superhero archetypes, such as the hero, anti-hero, or villain, shift in their representation over time?

**High-Level Steps**:
- Combine the CMU dataset with metadata on Marvel and DC Comics superheroes to explore how superhero narratives have evolved in response to societal changes.
- Analyze shifts in character traits, such as the rise of anti-heroes or the representation of minority characters.
- Map these changes to key societal movements, such as civil rights, feminism, or war narratives, to see how superhero films reflect the cultural mood of the time.
